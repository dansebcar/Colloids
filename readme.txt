This C++ code was written for an MSc Dissertation in Theoretical Physics at the University of Edinburgh by Daniel Carpenter. It uses the SFML library developed by Laurent Gomila to simulate the behaviour of active colloidal swimmers in 2 dimensions. The free font used is available here: https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/anonymous

With the current physical parameters, Janus clusters will form when the code is run. These are described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03245 (D Marenduzzo, B Liebchen and ME Cates, 2017). I used the code::blocks IDE to write this code, available here: http://www.codeblocks.org/
