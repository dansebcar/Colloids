This C++ code uses the SFML library developed by Laurent Gomila to simulate the behaviour of active colloidal swimmers in 2 dimensions. The free font used is available here: https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/anonymous

With the current physical parameters, Janus clusters will form when the code is run. These are described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03245 (D Marenduzzo, B Liebchen and ME Cates, 2017). I used the code::blocks IDE to write this code, available here: http://www.codeblocks.org/
